# Markdown-Excercise
This is the markdown excercise of BeCode

In this excercise we need to make a repository that contains two files:
- A ReadMe.md file that explains what this repository is for -which is this one-
- A Markdown.md file which explains what is Markdown and contains the rest of the mission as well.

## This is the Readme.md file
    
This repository is made purely as excercise in order to learn what is, and how to use Markdown.
In order to do that we need to have a shared repository that we all clone to our own machine,
 work on in different branches and merch them all together when we are finished.

This will learn us how to work with git and GitHub in team as well.
    --> So it should be a very good excercise for all of us.
